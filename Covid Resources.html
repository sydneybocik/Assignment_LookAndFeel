            The CDC recommends everyone ages 5 years and older to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Learn more from the CDC about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html">all approved vaccines available to the public</a>.

            <b>Lost COVID-19 Vaccine Card</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you lose your vaccination card or any record of it, return to the location that provided the vaccination if possible. To request proof of COVID-19 vaccination if you were vaccinated at a public site, complete the <a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=gI_NKEQ8J0uBoM0rA6MbjUA-GxB_oXpNtW9IlVYxeBNUNDY2N0VEN1hMRzQyWERKRllWREszMDIzWC4u">FDOH COVID Card Replacement Request</a> to receive your Immunization Clinic Record Card.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be aware the CDC COVID-19 vaccination record card is not an official record and will be replaced with a record from the official state's immunizations registry (Florida SHOTS).
        </p>
        <p>
            Your primary care physician's office also should be able to look up the record of your immunization.
